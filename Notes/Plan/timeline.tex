\section{Timeline}
Ideally, I will focus on implementing. executing and analysing two machine learning algorithms in the first term and then repeat the same process with a 3rd algorithm in term two. If able to complete these goals then I also plan to extend my project by implementing another regression-type algorithm to compare it with the ridge regression algorithm which is my main area of study.
