Supervisor Meeting

Inital supervisor meeting to discuss project and background information on structure of project.

Objectives set:
	-Need 3 datasets: Small, medium, and large, number of features (only small and large initially add medium later)
	-Implement 3 different machine learning algorithms: Ridge Regression, Decision trees (might change), Neural Networks(extendable)
	
By the first term must complete:
	-Explanation of algorithms and visualisation
	-Implementation of 2 algorithms
	-Run algorithms on 2 datasets
	-Analyse and compare their performance

FYP Plan Submitted

Finished my initial plan for my FYP and submitted it for grading. It was my first time really writing an abstract for a report, so it was very unfamiliar for me but in the end I managed to write something that I'm happy with. I wasn't sure how in-depth I should have gone into the maths behind the algorithm, but I managed to learn a lot early about how it functions which will make my life easier in the future as I already have a better understanding. 

Also created a timeline explaining my goals for each week so that I'm on track to completing all of my final deliverables. I think that I might have given myself more time than necessary for the tasks I set but in general it seems accurate and possible to follow.

The risks and mitigations sections was straightforward to write and I'll keep thinking about any other possible risks that might exist so that I can add them to the list and work on preventing them.
