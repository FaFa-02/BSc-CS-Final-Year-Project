Supervisor Meeting

Inital supervisor meeting to discuss project and background information on structure of project.

Objectives set:
	-Need 3 datasets: Small, medium, and large, number of features (only small and large initially add medium later)
	-Implement 3 different machine learning algorithms: Ridge Regression, Decision trees (might change), Neural Networks (extendable)
	
By the first term must complete:
	-Explanation of algorithms and visualisation
	-Implementation of 2 algorithms
	-Run algorithms on 2 datasets
	-Analyse and compare their performance

FYP Plan Submitted

Finished my initial plan for my FYP and submitted it for grading. It was my first time really writing an abstract for a report, so it was very unfamiliar for me but in the end I managed to write something that I'm happy with. I wasn't sure how in-depth I should have gone into the maths behind the algorithm, but I managed to learn a lot early about how it functions which will make my life easier in the future as I already have a better understanding. 

Also created a timeline explaining my goals for each week so that I'm on track to completing all of my final deliverables. I think that I might have given myself more time than necessary for the tasks I set but in general it seems accurate and possible to follow.

The risks and mitigations sections was straightforward to write and I'll keep thinking about any other possible risks that might exist so that I can add them to the list and work on preventing them.

Supervisor Meeting

Second Supervisor Meeting to asks specific questions on project after having a better understanding from writing the plan.

Questions:
	-When should I start writing up the actual report?
		Answer: As soon as possible, basically best to do it alongside implementation so that most of the work is done when it gets close to the deadline.
	
	-How much explaining of concepts should be done, i.e., how much information should I assume the reader knows?
		Answer: Can start from very basics (supervised vs unsupervised) but keep it extremely brief at the start of the report. Then go in depth on the theoretical explanations of algorithms and preprocessing. Also explain visualisation techniques but briefly as this is not the focus of the report.
		
	-What structure should I follow for write up?
		Answer: Intro, Theoretical Background (Include here algorithm/preprocessing explanations), Practical (Datasets and visualisation).
		
Extras:
	-Take a look at polynomial regression as a possible technique to use.
	-UCI to find other datasets.

Report Progress (Abstract, Introduction, Simple & Multiple Linear Regression)

Finished draft of abstract and introduction chapters of report. Included the importance of the project as a whole and what aims I strive to achieve by the end of it. Also defined what dataset I will be using and what algorithms I will implement to base the models on, as well as what performance measures I will use to analyse and compare their performances.

Have also started the theoretical background chapter of the report by laying out a plan of the sections that it will include and filling them in one by one. I have completed the draft for the general introduction into what is regression and linear regression in the context of machine learning, and I am currently working on mathematical definitions of the algorithms and of the cost functions used to optimize the parameters.

Report Progress (Simple & Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression)

Completed both the Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression subsections in the theory section. I have added theoretical explanations as well as formal mathematical definition with equations. Will start work on new chapter of Ridge Regression.
